## Cortical domain activity is state dependent  ##

* Previously demonstrated that general anesthesia abolishes spontaneous activity in visual system (Ackman Nature 2012). 
* What about ongoing activity in other cortical areas during early brain development? Surgical procedure relevance.
* No population calcium activity found during gen'l anesthesia, only slow traveling waves.
* During anesthesia induction, rapid (<30 s) knock down of discrete domain activity (P3 mouse <120518_09.tif>). Cingulate, retrosplenial activations the last to go-- default mode/resting state network areas last.

### Cortical activity and motor activity is periodic

Conclusions: The two hemispheres seem to be mostly synchronized, though it’s possible the R hemispshere (which is also the slightly more ‘active’ hemisphere, see stats table below) leads the left by a bit. The asymmetric peak at –150–175frames is interesting. That would be about 30–35 sec.

The big secondary peaks around ±30 sec is present in both autocorrs and xcorrs and is far above the random normal xcorr baseline (blue trace). In fact there is a periodicity seen in the autocorrs and the xcorrs where there is a dampening oscillation about on this interval! (See ideal dampening frequency in random sine wave example above). This corresponds to a 1/30sec == 0.033 Hz ultra-slow oscillation.

Looking at the above plot showing lags from [–1000, 1000] frames which is ± 200 s, we can see about 5.5 cycles of this underlying dampening oscillation in both autocorr plots. This corresponds to (1000fr*0.2sec/fr)/5.5 => 36.36 sec/cycle => 0.0275 cycles/sec or ~0.03 Hz



### Cortical activity is correlated with the motor signal
