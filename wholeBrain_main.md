# Summary  

The cerebral cortex exhibits spontaneous and sensory evoked patterns of activity during fetal and postnatal development that are crucial for the activity-dependent formation and refinement of neural circuits [#Katz:1996]. Knowing the source and flow of these activity patterns locally and globally is crucial to understanding self-organization in the developing brain. Here we show that neural population activity within newborn mice in vivo is characterized by spatially discrete domains that are coordinated in a state dependent and areal dependent fashion throughout developing neocortex. Whole brain optical recordings from neonatal mice expressing a genetic calcium reporter showed that ongoing activity in the cerebral cortex was characterized by distinct and repetitively active domains measuring hundreds of microns in diameter. Domain activity exhibited mirror-symmetric patterns between the hemispheres, with strong correlations between specific portions of frontal and parietal cortex. Ongoing activity across the cortical hemispheres showed characteristic network architectures with a frontal-motor regions functionally connected to a parietal-sensory areas through secondary motor/cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. Furthermore, ongoing activity was regulated by physiological state with cortical regions exhibiting areal dependent coordination of activity with motor behavior differentially during the course of development. This study provides the first comprehensive description of population activity in the developing neocortex at a scope and scale that bridges the microscopic or macroscopic spatiotemporal resolutions provided by traditional neurophysiological or neuroimaging techniques. Mesoscale maps of cortical population dynamics within animal models will be vital to future engineering of repair strategies and brain-machine interfaces for neurodevelopmental disorders.

# Introduction  

Brain development requires neural activity and calcium dynamics for establishing proper circuit structure and function. The importance of neural activity in the prenatal and postnatal period can be easily recognized in children exposed to chemical agents affecting neurotransmission during the fetal period that result in severe brain malformations, epilepsy, and mental retardation. Indeed, embryonic limb movements in species ranging from chick to human are thought to be initiated by spontaneous motor neuron activity in the spinal cord and thought to be crucial for activity-dependent development of motor synapses [Schoenberg:2003] [Marder,Lichtmann]. However it is only recently that we have begun to appreciate the underlying patterns of persistent neural activity that exist in the developing brain in vivo. For example, sensori-motor feedback associated with spontaneous movement generated by spinal motor neurons triggers synchronized 'spindle-burst' potentials among cells in somatosensory cortex [Yang:2009][Khazipov:2004a] before the start of locomotion and tactile behavior. Correlated bursts of activity occur in the developing rat hippocampus in vivo [#Leinekugel:2002] [Mohns&Blumberg]. Spontaneous retinal waves drive patterned activation of circuits throughout the immature visual system before the onset of vision [#Ackman:2012] [Hanganu,Colonnese?]. Furthermore, prenatal EEG recordings have demonstrated spindle burst oscillations and slow activity transients in the human infant somatosensory and occipital cortices before birth [#Vanhatalo:2005][#Tolonen:2007]. However, a comprehensive account of the dynamical patterns of persistent activity across the developing neocortex in vivo has not been undertaken, largely because a method to assess neural activity between most cortical areas simultaneously and non-invasively has not been available.

# Results

## Ongoing activity in developing neocortex is characterized by discrete domains

We performed transcranial optical recordings from mice expressing the genetic calcium reporter GCaMP (GCaMP3 or GCaMP6) throughout cortical neurons to assess neural population activity patterns with mesoscopic spatial and temporal resolutions (10s of microns and 100s of milliseconds) at macroscopic scale (millimeters). We performed our recordings in three age groups during the first two postnatal weeks during which the mouse brain develops to >90% of its adult weight [#Kobayashi:1963]: P2-P5, P8-P9, and P12-13. Functional mesoscale optical imaging (fMOI) revealed that supracellular cortical activity patterns were characterized by discrete domains of activation (Fig. 1a-c) [Supplementary Movie 1](../wholeBrain_blob/ackmanWholeBrainGcampP3.mov). These activity domains ranged from 250 - 976 µm in diameter and 0.4 - 2.6 s in duration <!--(10-90th percentiles)-->(Table 1.) (*Ns*, Fig. 1e-h).

The duration of domain activations was not significantly affected by age (F = 0.933, p = 0.428, r^2 = 0.00567) or by hemisphere (F = 0.017, p = 0.900) (P2-5, N = 15653; P8-9, N = 70189; P12-13, N = 120214 domains) (Fig. 1e,f).

There was a significant effect of age on the diameter of cortical domain activations(F = 25.788, p = 0.000188, r^2 = 0.1277), but not hemisphere (F = 0.192, p = 0.671808) (Fig. 1g,h).

Cortical calcium domain frequency significantly increased with age (F = 29.562, p = 8.86e-12, r^2 = 0.2535) and did not differ significantly between the hemispheres (F = 0.012, p = 0.911) (P2-5, N = 22; P8-9, N = 30; P12-13, N = 38 movies/hemi) (Fig. 1i,j).

The neocortex exhibits a characteristic modular organization across the cortical surface such that vertical arrays of cells concerned with specific sensory features are grouped together as columns in a topographic fashion [#Mountcastle:1997]. Most evidence to date suggests that cortical columns range from 300-600µm diameter, even between species whose brain volumes differ by a factor of 10^3 [#Mountcastle:1997].

We parcellated the brain into distinct anatomical boundaries by using reference coordinates from a mouse line that expressed the tdtomato reporter in thalamocortical afferents (Fig. 1c,d). Patterns of thalamocortical axon terminal can be used to parcellate out areal boundaries of primary sensory cortical areas [wong riley 1979]. We matched these parcellations to a Allen brain atlas adult mouse reference image and than linearly scaled the remaining parcellations in our FOV on to the images of our recordings that contain functional boundaries (like in the domain centroid activation plot and in the domain frequency maps).

Longer duration domains of activation occurred in the visual cortex and motor cortex (*Ns*, Fig. 2b,c). In the second postnatal week the size of cortical activity domains became larger in the frontal-motor and S1-limb/body regions [Supplementary Movie 2](../wholeBrain_blob/ackmanWholeBrainImaging-lo.mov). 

There were longer activations on the order of seconds to tens of seconds in visual cortex driven by retinal waves [#Ackman:2012]. Long lasting wave-like activations also occured in motor cortex P2-5 (Fig 2 montage).

## Cortical domain activity is state dependent

* Previously demonstrated that general anesthesia abolishes spontaneous activity in visual system [#Ackman:2012]. 
* During anesthesia induction, there is rapid (<30 s) knock down of discrete domain activity (P3 mouse <120518_09.tif>) at all ages. Cingulate, retrosplenial activations the last to go-- 
* No population calcium activity found during gen'l anesthesia in neonates. Altered spontaneous patterns in older mice.
default mode/resting state network areas last.

Variation in the strength of correlation between cortical areas and the motor movement signal depended on brain region (p < 2.2e-16, anova) and age (p = 1.627e-05, anova)  The first age group in which motor cortex exhibited signficant positive correlation with motor movements was at P12-13 (r=0.06±0.02, p-value = 0.001449, t-test).

## Cortical activity is mirrored between the hemispheres

* Inter hemispheric functional connectivity, importance for autism, schizophrenia. Maybe an activity-dependent mechanism for commisural connectivity.
* olavarria work, evidence for inter hemispheric activity dependence
* [#Hanganu:2006], 30% of spindle bursts correlated across hemispheres

To understand the patterns and how they interact we first looked at correlation between the hemispheres. Cortical activity exhibited high temporal correlation between the hemispheres () . In additon this activity was highly correlated in the spatial dimension.  We found that activity was correlated in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. It exhibited mirror symmetric and non-mirror symmetric patterns. For example epochs of time would exhibit high correlation in the medial-lateral dimension or in the rostral-caudal dimension. This strength of correlation temporally and spatially increased between the hemsipheres with a function of age.

Notice the peaks above gaussian distributed noise (blue traces).](figure4.png)



## Developing cortical activity consists of distinct subnetworks

We then calculated a matrix of pearsons correlation coefficients based on the pixel active fraction timecourses for each pair of parcellations. The resulting assocaition matrix was run through a hierarchal clustering alogtithm to reveal functional modules of of activation. These functional modules typically consisted of 3 distinct subnetworks-- a frontal motor network, a posterior parietal network, a S1-body/limb network, and an auditory A1 network at P12.

We found many similarities but some striking differences as a function of age.
