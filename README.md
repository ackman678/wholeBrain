# wholeBrain imaging paper

The goal of this work is to provide a broad description of the population activity patterns that occur in developing cerebral cortex.

The main manuscript file is [wholeBrain_main.md][]

## Rationale

The idea is to provide a clear and beautiful visualization of the immature activity patterns in the developing brain.

We can do this because

## Workflow

Workflow will be similar to that used previously for [current opinion review][id3]. Some useful info in [currOpinRvw outline][id2].
